                          "I was skeptical at first about a game that promised
                          to teach me coding, but Dungeon and Coding exceeded my
                          expectations. The puzzles and obstacles in the game
                          are challenging but not impossible, and the game does
                          a great job of introducing new coding concepts in a
                          way that's easy to understand. I also love the
                          adventure aspect of the game, it made me feel like a
                          real code-slinging adventurer. Definitely a must-try
                          for anyone interested in coding."

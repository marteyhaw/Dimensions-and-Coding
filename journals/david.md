I am currently attempting to create a test case where I can simulate a successful sign in without utilizing the actual database. This will allow me to test the sign in functionality of the application without the need for a live database connection, and will also allow me to test the application's behavior in the event of a database failure or error. By using a fake database, I will be able to control the input and output of the sign in process, and ensure that the application behaves as expected.
​
Despite some initial challenges, I am determined to create this test case to help me identify any bugs or issues in the sign-in process and make any necessary adjustments before the application is released to the public. However, I am currently running into many bugs and it's taking me longer than expected. I will keep working on it and trying to find a solution.
​
Later that night, I spent most of my time working on the front-end styling for the campground section of our project.
I then began working on implementing some new CSS styles to make the campground section look more visually appealing.
I spent a lot learning about css.
​
In the end, I am satisfied with the results and I believe that the new styling will enhance the overall user experience of the campground section. I am excited to see how it will look when it's finally live.

Today, I started to refactor our code by implementing RTK with the help of our teammates. It was a bit of a challenge to be honest.
I also spent some time continuing to plan out how to write the unit tests for our code. I have been reading about different testing frameworks and strategies and I am starting to feel more confident about how to approach this task.
In addition, I managed to finish the authentication process for both the front-end and back-end. This was a big accomplishment as it is a crucial part of our app. I am glad that we were able to get this done.
​
January 23, 2023
Today, our team and I had discuss on how to improve our front-end. After learning about it yesterday, we decided that it would be the best approach to use RTK.
After class, I took some time to watch a few videos on Caprover to figure out how to deploy our app. I need to rewatch the videos once more.
I also spent some time working on the sign-up and sign-in functionality for our app. This was a bit challenging as it required some fine-tuning of the authentication process, but I was able to get it working as expected.

Today was a productive day in terms of creating the outline for our landing page. One tool that proved to be extremely helpful was RTK. It was amazing how easily it allowed us to apply the token to all aspects of the project. It made the process so much more streamlined and efficient.
​
One of the highlights of the day was having an "aha" moment when it came to understanding how RTK works. I had been struggling with some aspects of refactoring but after having a high level conversation with my teammates and experimenting with it. Overall, RTK has been a game changer for our application and I can't wait to see the final result.

Today, I worked on completing the backend for our endpoints. I was able to successfully finish this task by the help of my entire team and move on to working on the login and signup forms for the front end.
​
While working on the form design, I had an "AHA" moment when I realized that by implementing a specific validation method, it would greatly improve the user experience and make the forms more secure. I immediately incorporated this method into my design and am excited to see the positive impact it will have.
​
I am now writing the jsx for the visualization of the form. Overall, it was a productive day and I am looking forward to continuing my work on this project.

Today was an exciting day for me! I spent some time going over my notes with my classmates and was able to make a lot of progress on one of my endpoints. With their help and guidance, I was able to get the endpoint fully functional and working correctly. I was thrilled to see all of my hard work come together and to see the endpoint working as it should.
​
One of the most exciting parts of the day was when I was able to create a JSON Web Token (JWT) with my user. This was a major milestone for me as it means that my authentication and authorization feature is working correctly. I am now able to secure my user's data and ensure that only authorized users have access to it.
​
I am grateful to have classmates who are willing to help and support me in my learning journey. I am looking forward to continuing to work on my endpoints and to make more progress on my project.

Today, I had the opportunity to help my team member, Edmund, review his CRUD method feature. He had been working on it for some time and was having difficulty getting it to work correctly. I took a look at his code and was able to identify several issues that were causing the problems. We went through the code together, and I helped him understand where the errors were and how to fix them.
​
After reviewing the code and making some improvements, Edmund was able to get the CRUD method feature working correctly. I was impressed with his ability to quickly understand and implement the changes that were needed. I then reviewed the fixed issue and after making sure everything was working as expected, I approved it to be merged to the main branch.
​
It was great to see Edmund's progress and the teamwork that was put in to fix the issue. I am proud to be part of a team that works together to find solutions and make improvements. I am confident that this feature will be beneficial for the project and for our users.

Yesterday was a day of success for our team! We were able to successfully complete and submit our first merge request, ensuring that our work is integrated with the main branch. We reviewed each other's issues and solved any merge request problems that may arise. Additionally, we created an example database to demonstrate one of our features.
​
Today, we plan to work on our endpoints, making sure that all of the necessary endpoints are functional and perhaps polishing them. We also plan to work on authentication for users, ensuring that our users are able to securely access our API.
​
However, we did experience some blockers yesterday. We had a number of pipeline issues due to our GitLab account not being verified. We need to make sure that our GitLab account is verified to avoid such issues. We will work on resolving this issue as soon as possible so that we can continue to make progress on our project.

Today, I was able to create a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, but I ran into some issues when trying to access the token that goes with it. I had implemented the token creation and authentication features, but for some reason, I was unable to access the token and use it to secure my application.
​
I spent a lot of time troubleshooting and trying to figure out what was causing the problem. I reviewed my code, looked for any errors, and tried different approaches, but I was unable to find a solution. This was a frustrating experience, as I had put a lot of work into creating the CRUD application and I wanted to ensure that it was secure.
​
I will continue to investigate and troubleshoot the issue. I will also reach out to my classmates or online resources to see if they can offer any insight or solutions. I am determined to find a way to access the token and secure my application.

​
I have been continuing to work on my API and I have made some additional updates. I have implemented a password hashing library to securely hash and store user passwords, and I have also implemented a way for users to log in and log out of the API. I have also added the ability for users to update their account information, such as their email address or password.
​
I have been testing these updates and everything seems to be working as expected. I have also been reviewing the code to make sure that it is properly structured and well-commented, which will make it easier to maintain and update in the future. I am feeling confident that my API is secure and user-friendly, and I am excited to continue working on it.

​
I have been working on my API and I have made some progress in understanding the difference between creating a user token and creating a user. I have learned that a user token is used for authentication and authorization, while creating a user is the process of creating a new account for the API. I have also learned that it is best practice to have separate endpoints for each action, so that the process of creating a user and creating a token can be handled separately and securely.
​
I have decided to implement separate endpoints for creating a user and creating a token. I have also implemented proper validation and error handling for each endpoint to ensure that they are secure and user-friendly. I am excited to continue testing and refining my API.
​
January 5, 2023:
Today, I am building an API using FastAPI and I am trying to understand the difference between creating a user token and creating a user. I am wondering if I need to have a separate endpoint for both actions or if they can be combined into one endpoint. I have been researching and studying the best practices for user authentication and token management in APIs, but I am still unsure about how to implement it in my specific use case. I am excited to continue learning and experimenting with different approaches to see what works best for my API.

Today was a productive day for our group. We were able to divide the point system among the MVP for our project. This will help us track our progress and ensure that all tasks are being completed effectively.
​
In addition to this, we made progress on several other tasks. We continued modeling models/tables, solidified designations, and confirmed the type and scheme for our database.
​
We also took the time to set up everyone's local repository and initiate coding. These steps will allow us to collaborate more efficiently as we work on the project. Overall, it was a successful day and we are making good progress.
​
One of the "aha" moments for me today was when we figured out why the GHI application wasn't working in our Docker container. It turns out that the database URL contained the example database name, instead of "postgres," which is our official database name.
​
This realization helped us identify the issue and find a solution. By updating the database URL to reflect the correct name, we were able to get the GHI application up and running smoothly in the Docker container. It was a small but important problem to solve, and I'm glad we were able to do so efficiently.

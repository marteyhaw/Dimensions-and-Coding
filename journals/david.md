Today was a productive day for our group. We were able to divide the point system among the MVP for our project. This will help us track our progress and ensure that all tasks are being completed effectively.

In addition to this, we made progress on several other tasks. We continued modeling models/tables, solidified designations, and confirmed the type and scheme for our database.

We also took the time to set up everyone's local repository and initiate coding. These steps will allow us to collaborate more efficiently as we work on the project. Overall, it was a successful day and we are making good progress.

One of the "aha" moments for me today was when we figured out why the GHI application wasn't working in our Docker container. It turns out that the database URL contained the example database name, instead of "postgres," which is our official database name.

This realization helped us identify the issue and find a solution. By updating the database URL to reflect the correct name, we were able to get the GHI application up and running smoothly in the Docker container. It was a small but important problem to solve, and I'm glad we were able to do so efficiently.



```In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:
The date of the entry
A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small
Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top.
Here's a sample of the first two entries of someone's journal file.```
